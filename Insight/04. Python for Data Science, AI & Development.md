- Applied Software Engineering Fundamentals

### Python Basic

- Python can distinguish among data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Booleans.
- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative.
- Floats are numbers that have decimal points; they can represent whole or fractional values.
- You can convert integers to floats using typecasting and vice-versa.
- You can convert integers and floats to strings.
- You can convert an integer or float to a Boolean: 0 becomes False, non-zero becomes True.
- Expressions in Python are a combination of values and operations used to produce a single result.
- Expressions perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and so on.
- We can use // to perform integer division, which results in an integer value by discarding the fractional part.
- Python follows the order of operations (BODMAS) to perform operations with multiple expressions.
- Variables store and manipulate data, allowing you to access and modify values throughout your code.
- The assignment operator "=" assigns a value to a variable.
- Assigning another value to the same variable overrides the previous value of that variable.
- You can perform mathematical operations on variables using the same or different variables.
- Modifying the value of one variable will affect other variables only if they reference the same mutable object.
- Python string operations involve manipulating text data using tasks such as indexing, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
- A string is usually written within double quotes or single quotes, including letters, white space, digits, or special characters.
- A string can be assigned to a variable and is an ordered sequence of characters.
- Characters in a string identify their index numbers, which can be positive or negative.
- Strings are sequences that support operations like indexing and slicing.
- You can input a stride value to perform slicing while operating on a string.
- Operations like concatenation and replication produce new strings, while finding the length of a string returns a number.
- You cannot modify an existing string; they are immutable. 
- You can use escape sequences with a backslash (\) to change the layout of a string. (For example, \n for a new line, \t for a tab, and \\ for a backslash, etc.)
- In Python, you perform tasks such as searching, modifying, and formatting text data with its pre-built string methods.
- You apply a method to a string to change its value, resulting in another string. 
- You can perform actions such as changing the case of characters in a string, replacing items in a string, finding items in a string, and so on using pre-built string methods.

### Glossary: Python Basics

Welcome! This alphabetized glossary contains many of the terms you'll find within this course. This comprehensive glossary also includes additional industry-recognized terms not used in course videos. These terms are important for you to recognize when working in the industry, participating in user groups, and participating in other certificate programs.

|Array of numbers|Set of numbers or objects that follow a pattern presented as an arrangement of rows and columns to explain multiplication.|
|Assignment operator in Python|Assignment operator is a type of Binary operator that helps in modifying the variable to its left with the use of its value to the right. The symbol used for assignment operator is "=".|
|Asterisk|Symbol "* " used to perform various operations in Python.|
|Backslash|A backslash is an escape character used in Python strings to indicate that the character immediately following it should be treated in a special way, such as being treated as escaped character or raw string.|
|Boolean|Denoting a system of algebraic notation used to represent logical propositions by means of the binary digits 0 (false) and 1 (true).|
|Colon|A colon is used to represent an indented block. It is also used to fetch data and index ranges or arrays.|
|Concatenate|Link (things) together in a chain or series.|
|Data engineering|Data engineers are responsible for turning raw data into information that an organization can understand and use. Their work involves blending, testing, and optimizing data from numerous sources.|
|Data science|Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge from data sets which are typically huge in amount. The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization.|
|Data type|Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied without causing an error.|
|Double quote|Symbol “ “ used to represent strings in Python.|
|Escape sequence|An escape sequence is two or more characters that often begin with an escape character that tell the computer to perform a function or command.|
|Expression|An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.|
|Float|Python float () function is used to return a floating-point number from a number or a string representation of a numeric value.|
|Forward slash|Symbol “/“ used to perform various operations in Python|
