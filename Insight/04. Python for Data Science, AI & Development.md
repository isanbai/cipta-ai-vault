## Python Basic

- Python can distinguish among data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Booleans.
- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative.
- Floats are numbers that have decimal points; they can represent whole or fractional values.
- You can convert integers to floats using typecasting and vice-versa.
- You can convert integers and floats to strings.
- You can convert an integer or float to a Boolean: 0 becomes False, non-zero becomes True.
- Expressions in Python are a combination of values and operations used to produce a single result.
- Expressions perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and so on.
- We can use // to perform integer division, which results in an integer value by discarding the fractional part.
- Python follows the order of operations (BODMAS) to perform operations with multiple expressions.
- Variables store and manipulate data, allowing you to access and modify values throughout your code.
- The assignment operator "=" assigns a value to a variable.
- Assigning another value to the same variable overrides the previous value of that variable.
- You can perform mathematical operations on variables using the same or different variables.
- Modifying the value of one variable will affect other variables only if they reference the same mutable object.
- Python string operations involve manipulating text data using tasks such as indexing, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
- A string is usually written within double quotes or single quotes, including letters, white space, digits, or special characters.
- A string can be assigned to a variable and is an ordered sequence of characters.
- Characters in a string identify their index numbers, which can be positive or negative.
- Strings are sequences that support operations like indexing and slicing.
- You can input a stride value to perform slicing while operating on a string.
- Operations like concatenation and replication produce new strings, while finding the length of a string returns a number.
- You cannot modify an existing string; they are immutable. 
- You can use escape sequences with a backslash (\) to change the layout of a string. (For example, \n for a new line, \t for a tab, and \\ for a backslash, etc.)
- In Python, you perform tasks such as searching, modifying, and formatting text data with its pre-built string methods.
- You apply a method to a string to change its value, resulting in another string. 
- You can perform actions such as changing the case of characters in a string, replacing items in a string, finding items in a string, and so on using pre-built string methods.

### Format Strings in Python

Format strings are a way to inject variables into a string in Python. They are used to format strings and produce more human-readable outputs. There are several ways to format strings in Python:

### String interpolation (f-strings)

Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings are a new way to format strings in Python. They are prefixed with 'f' and use curly braces {} to enclose the variables that will be formatted. For example:

1. `name = "John"`
2. `age = 30`
3. `print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")`

This will output:

1. `My name is John and I am 30 years old.`

### str.format()

This is another way to format strings in Python. It uses curly braces {} as placeholders for variables which are passed as arguments in the format() method. For example:

1. `name = "John"`
2. `age = 50`
3. `print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))`

This will output:

1. `My name is John and I am 50 years old.`

### % Operator

This is one of the oldest ways to format strings in Python. It uses the % operator to replace variables in the string. For example:

1. `name = "Johnathan"`
2. `age = 30`
3. `print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))`

This will output:

1. `My name is Johnathan and I am 30 years old.`

“**My name is %s and I am %d years old.**“: This is a string that includes format specifiers:

- **%s**: This is a placeholder for a string.
- **%d**: This is a placeholder for an integer.

**% (name, age)**: This is a tuple containing the variables name and age. The values of these variables will replace the placeholders in the string.

Each of these methods has its own advantages and use cases. However, f-strings are generally considered the most modern and preferred way to format strings in Python due to their readability and performance.

### Additional capabilities

F-strings are also able to evaluate expressions inside the curly braces, which can be very handy. For example:

1. `x = 10`
2. `y = 20`
3. `print(f"The sum of x and y is {x+y}.")`

This will output:

1. `The sum of x and y is 30.`

### Raw String (r’’)

In Python, raw strings are a powerful tool for handling textual data, especially when dealing with escape characters. By prefixing a string literal with the letter ‘r’, Python treats the string as raw, meaning it interprets backslashes as literal characters rather than escape sequences.

Consider the following examples of regular string and raw string:

**Regular string:**

1. `regular_string = "C:\new_folder\file.txt"`
2. `print("Regular String:", regular_string)`

This will output:

1. `Regular String:  C:`
2. `ew_folderile.txt`

In the regular string regular_string variable, the backslashes (\n) are interpreted as escape sequences. Therefore, \n represents a newline character, which would lead to an incorrect file path representation.

**Raw string:**

1. `raw_string = r"C:\new_folder\file.txt"`
2. `print("Raw String:", raw_string)`

This will output:

1. `Raw String: C:\new_folder\file.txt`

However, in the raw string raw_string, the backslashes are treated as literal characters. This means that \n is not interpreted as a newline character, but rather as two separate characters, \ and n. Consequently, the file path is represented exactly as it appears.

## Python Data Structures

- In Python, we often use tuples to group related data together.Tuples refer to ordered and immutable collections of elements.
- Tuples are usually written as comma-separated elements in parentheses “()".
- You can include strings, integers, and floats in tuples and access them using both positive and negative indices.
- You can perform operations such as combining, concatenating, and slicing on tuples.
- Tuples are immutable, so you need to create a new tuple to manipulate it.
- Tuples, termed nesting, can include other tuples of complex data types.
- You can access elements in a nested tuple through indexing.
- Lists in Python contain ordered collections of items that can hold elements of different types and are mutable, allowing for versatile data storage and manipulation.
- A list is an ordered sequence, represented with square brackets "[]".
- Lists possess mutability, rendering them akin to tuples.
- A list can contain strings, integers, and floats; you can nest lists within it.
- You can access each element in a list using both positive and negative indexing.
- Concatenating or appending a list will result in the modification of the same list.
- You can perform operations such as adding, deleting, splitting, and so forth on a list.
- You can separate elements in a list using delimiters.
- Aliasing occurs when multiple names refer to the same object.
- You can also clone a list to create another list.
- Dictionaries in Python are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to store and retrieve data based on unique keys.
- Dictionaries consist of keys and values, both composed of string elements.
- You denote dictionaries using curly brackets.
- The keys necessitate immutability and uniqueness.
- The values may be either immutable or mutable, and they allow duplicates.
- You separate each key-value pair with a comma, and you can use color highlighting to make the key more visible.
- You can assign dictionaries to a variable.
- You use the key as an argument to retrieve the corresponding value.
- You can make additions and deletions to dictionaries.
- You can perform an operation on a dictionary to check the key, which results in a true or false output.
- You can apply methods to obtain a list of keys and values in a dictionary.
- Sets in Python are collections of unique elements, useful for tasks such as removing duplicates and performing set operations like union and intersection. Sets lack order.
- Curly brackets "{}" are helpful for defining elements of a set.
- Sets do not contain duplicate items.
- A list passed through the set function generates a set containing unique elements.
- You use “Set Operations” to perform actions such as adding, removing, and verifying elements in a set.
- You can combine sets using the ampersand "&" operator to obtain the common elements from both sets.
- You can use the Union function to combine two sets, including both the common and unique elements from both sets.
- The sub-set method is used to determine if two or more sets are subsets.

### 📌 Definisi :

- **Dict 🗂️** → Struktur data pasangan **key-value**, seperti kartu indeks, selalu ada _key_ → _value_.
- **String 🔤** → Urutan karakter (text), deretan huruf, tidak bisa diubah setelah dibuat.
- **Range ➡️** → Representasi urutan angka, jalur angka berurutan, biasanya dipakai buat loop.
- **Boolean** → Hanya punya dua nilai → `True` atau `False`

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creating a Dictionary | A dictionary is a built-in data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.                                  | Example:<br><br>1. `dict_name = {} #Creates an empty dictionary`<br>2. `person = { "name": "John",  "age": 30, "city": "New York"}`                                                                                                                |
| Accessing Values      | You can access the values in a dictionary using their corresponding `keys`.                                                                                            | Syntax:<br><br>1. `Value = dict_name["key_name"]`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `name = person["name"]`<br>2. `age = person["age"]`                                                                                  |
| Add or modify         | Inserts a new key-value pair into the dictionary. If the key already exists, the value will be updated; otherwise, a new entry is created.                             | Syntax:<br><br>1. `dict_name[key] = value`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `person["Country"] = "USA" # A new entry will be created.`<br>2. `person["city"] = "Chicago"  # Update the existing value for the same key` |
| del                   | Removes the specified key-value pair from the dictionary. Raises a `KeyError` if the key does not exist.                                                               | Syntax:<br><br>1. `del dict_name[key]`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `del person["Country"]`                                                                                                                         |
| update()              | The `update()` method merges the provided dictionary into the existing dictionary, adding or updating key-value pairs.                                                 | Syntax:<br><br>1. `dict_name.update({key: value})`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `person.update({"Profession": "Doctor"})`                                                                                           |
| clear()               | The `clear()` method empties the dictionary, removing all key-value pairs within it. After this operation, the dictionary is still accessible and can be used further. | Syntax:<br><br>1. `dict_name.clear()`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `grades.clear()`                                                                                                                                 |
| key existence         | You can check for the existence of a key in a dictionary using the `in` keyword                                                                                        | Example:<br><br>1. `if "name" in person:`<br>2.     `print("Name exists in the dictionary.")`                                                                                                                                                      |
| copy()                | Creates a shallow copy of the dictionary. The new dictionary contains the same key-value pairs as the original, but they remain distinct objects in memory.            | Syntax:<br><br>1. `new_dict = dict_name.copy()`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `new_person = person.copy()`<br>2. `new_person = dict(person) # another way to create a copy of dictionary`                            |
| keys()                | Retrieves all keys from the dictionary and converts them into a list. Useful for iterating or processing keys using list methods.                                      | Syntax:<br><br>1. `keys_list = list(dict_name.keys())`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `person_keys = list(person.keys())`                                                                                             |
| values()              | Extracts all values from the dictionary and converts them into a list. This list can be used for further processing or analysis.                                       | Syntax:<br><br>1. `values_list = list(dict_name.values())`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `person_values = list(person.values())`                                                                                     |
| items()               | Retrieves all key-value pairs as tuples and converts them into a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a key and its corresponding value.                             | Syntax:<br><br>1. `items_list = list(dict_name.items())`<br><br>          <br><br>        <br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `info = list(person.items())`                                                                                                 |

They are useful for storing distinct values and performing set operations.                 | Example:<br><br>1. `empty_set = set() #Creating an Empty Set` <br>2. `fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}`<br>3. `colors = ("orange", "red", "green")`<br>  <br><br>**Note:** These two sets will be used in the examples that follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| discard()      | Use the `discard()` method to remove a specific element from the set. Ignores if the element is not found.                                                                              | Syntax:<br><br>1. `set_name.discard(element)` <br><br><br>Example:<br><br>1. `fruits.discard("apple")`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| issubset()     | The `issubset()` method checks if the current set is a subset of another set.

## Python Programming Fundamentals

- Python conditions use “if” statements to execute code based on true/false conditions created by comparisons and Boolean expressions.
- Comparison operations require using comparison operators such as == (equal to), > (greater than), and < (less than).
- Python uses the "!=" operator to determine whether two values are not equal.
- You can compare integers, strings, and floats.
- Python branching directs program flow by using conditional statements (for example, if, else, elif) to execute different code blocks based on conditions or tests.
- You can use the "if" statement with conditions to define actions if true.
- To perform actions when all previous conditions are false, you can use the "else" statement without a condition.
- The elif statement allows for additional checks only if the initial condition is false.
- To execute various operations on Boolean values, we use Boolean logic operators.
- Python loops are control structures that automate repetitive tasks and iterate over data structures like lists or dictionaries.
- The range() function generates a sequence of numbers with a specified start, stop, and step value for loops in Python.
- A for loop in Python iterates over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string, and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
- A while loop in Python executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
- Python functions are reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks, take input parameters, and often return results, enhancing code modularity and reusability.
- You may or may not have written the codes that are often included in functions.
- Python has a set of built-in functions such as "len" to find the length of a sequence or "sum" to find the total sum of a sequence.
- The "sorted" function creates a new sorted list, while "sort" sorts items in the original list.
- You can also create your own functions in Python.
- To ensure clarity and organization and facilitate understanding and maintenance of the code, developers must document functions using a documentation string enclosed in three quotes.
- The help command will return the documentation defined for a particular function.
- A function can have multiple parameters.
- If a function does not include a return statement, it returns None by default.
- You can use the "pass" keyword in a function to indicate that it does nothing (a placeholder for future code).
- A function will usually perform more than one task.
- In Python, the scope of a variable determines where you can access or modify that variable. Global scope allows access from anywhere, while local scope restricts it to a block or function.
- In Python, a programmer defines a local variable within a specific block or function, which can only be accessed or modified within that block or function.
- In Python, a global variable is a variable defined at the top level of a program that any part of the code can access or modify. 
- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing and responding to errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution, preventing them from crashing the program.
- In Python, you use the "try-except" statement to attempt a block of code and specify alternative actions to execute if an error occurs, allowing you to handle exceptions. 
- In Python, you use the "try-except-else" statement to attempt a block of code, handle exceptions in the "except" block, and execute code in the "else" block when no exceptions occur. 
- Python developers use the "try-except-else-finally" statement to attempt a block of code, catch exceptions in the "except" block, execute code in the "else" block when no exceptions occur, and ensure that the "finally" block always runs, regardless of whether exception was raised or not.
- In Python, objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior, serving as the foundation for creating and working with various data types and custom data structures.
- To determine the type of an object in Python, you can use the `type()` command.
- Methods may modify an object’s internal state, but the object’s type usually remains the same.
- Classes in Python are blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods, enabling code organization, and object-oriented programming.
- Function "init" is a special method used to initialize data attributes.
- We can create instances of a class in Python.
- Data attributes consist of the data defining the objects.
- Methods are functions that interact and change the data attributes.

| For loops                | For loops in Python are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects, executing a set of statements for each item in the sequence.                                                                     |
| Global variable          | Global variables in Python are variables defined outside of any function or block and can be accessed and modified from any part of the code.                                                                                                             |
| Incremented              | "Incremented" in Python means to increase the value of a variable by a specified amount, typically done using the += operator or by adding a fixed value.                                                                                                 |
| Indent                   | In Python, "indent" refers to the use of whitespace at the beginning of a line to signify the structure and scope of code blocks, such as loops and functions.                                                                                            |
| Indices                  | In Python, "indices" refer to the position or location of elements in a sequence, like a string, list, or tuple, starting with 0 for the first element.                                                                                                   |
| Iterate                  | In Python, "iterate" means to repeatedly perform a set of operations or steps on each item in a collection, such as a list, tuple, or dictionary, typically using loops or iterators.                                                                     |
| Local variables          | Local variables in Python are variables defined within a specific function or block of code and are only accessible within that function or block.                                                                                                        |
| Logic operators          | Logic operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values, including operators like and (logical AND), or (logical OR), and not (logical NOT).                                                                                   |
| Loops                    | Loops in Python are constructs for repeating a block of code, enabling the execution of the same code multiple times.                                                                                                                                     |
| Parameters               | Parameters in Python are placeholders in a function definition, used to accept and work with values provided to the function when it is called.                                                                                                           |
| Programming Fundamentals | Programming fundamentals in Python involve variables, control structures, functions, data structures, input/output, and error handling for building software.                                                                                             |
| Range function           | The range function in Python generates a sequence of numbers that can be used for iterating in a loop and is typically used as range (start, stop, step), where it creates numbers from start to stop-1 with the given step increment.                    |
| Scope of function        | The "scope of a function" in Python refers to the region of code where a variable defined within that function is accessible or visible.                                                                                                                  |
