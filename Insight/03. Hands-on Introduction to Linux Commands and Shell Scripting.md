### Introduction to Linux

- In the 1980s, GNU was developed at MIT. GNU stands for “GNU’s not Unix” and was made as a free, open source set of the existing Unix system tools. And in 1991, Linus Torvalds developed a free, open source version of the Unix kernel called Linux.
    
- Linux is widely used today in mobile devices, desktops, supercomputers, data centers, and cloud servers.
    
- Linux distributions (also known as distros) differ by their UIs, shell applications, and how the OS is supported and built.
    
- The design of a distro is catered toward its specific audience and/or use case. Popular Linux distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, Ubuntu, Suse (SLES, SLED, OpenSuse), Fedora, Mint, and Arch.
    
- The Linux system consists of five key layers: the UI, application, OS, kernel, and hardware. The user interface enables users to interact with applications. Applications enable users to perform tasks within the system. The operating system runs on top of the kernel and is vital for system health and stability, and the kernel is the lowest-level software that enables applications to interact with hardware. Hardware includes all the physical or electronic components of your PC.
    
- The Linux filesystem is a tree-like structure consisting of all directories and files on the system.
    
- A Linux shell is an OS-level application that you can use to enter commands. You use a terminal to send commands to the shell, and you can use the `cd` command to navigate around your Linux filesystem.
    
- You can use a variety of command-line or GUI-based text editors such as GNU nano, vim, vi, and gedit.
    
- .deb and .rpm are distinct file types used by package mangers in Linux operating systems.
    
- You can use GUI-based and command-line package managers to update and install software on Linux systems.
