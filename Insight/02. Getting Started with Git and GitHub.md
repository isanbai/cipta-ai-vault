### Git and GitHub Fundamentals

- Git is a versatile version control system used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with others on software projects.
- Due to a distributed version control system, Git enables you to revert to the previous state or review the projectâ€™s history.
- GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for Git repositories.
- Repositories are storage structures that store documents, including application source code, and enable contributors to track and maintain version control.
    
- Git repository model
    
- Primarily focused on tracking source code during development.
    
- Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes, and support non-linear workflows.
    
- Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track Issues, and enable you to collaborate with others.
    
- GitHub enables you to create repositories, edit files using the web interface, commit the changes to the file, upload the files, and a lot more.

- A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes.
    
- In the child branch, you can build, make edits, test the changes, and then merge them with the main branch.
    
- To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.
    
- A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch.

### Git Commands and Managing GitHub Projects

- GitHub has over 100 million repositories. You can clone a repository and sync changes back to the original. You can also fork a repository and use it as the base for the new project or work on that project independently.
    
- The steps included in a GitHub workflow are:
    
    - Clone the remote repository or initialize a Git repository.
        
    - Move files to a staging area.
        
    - Perform an initial commit.
        
    - Create a branch and work on it.
        
    - Add files to the staging area and commit.
        
    - Push local commits to the remote repository.
        
    - Create a pull request for review and merging.
        
    - Use the pull operation to update the local repository.
        
- Multiple roles are involved in managing a project: Developer, Integrator, and Repository Administrator.
    
    - A Developer working in a group project uses commands like git clone, git pull, git fetch, git push, and git request-pull in addition to the ones needed by a standalone developer.
        
    - An Integrator in a group project reviews and integrates changes made by others. Integrators use commands like git pull, git revert, and git push in addition to the ones needed by participants.
        
    - Repository Administrators structure how the repository is organized and how users interact with the repository. They also configure the servers needed for accessing the web services and documentation, define email and index settings, and manage the look and feel of the application.
        
- The following table shows various Git commands:
    

|            |              |                                |                         |                         |
